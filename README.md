# Pug landing-page


The website is for pug adoption in general.

The data are taken online and VELCRO is not a real operating site. 

The site is only for practice purpose for the Odin Project. 

The website is on https://weeehung.github.io/Landing-page/

Problem with this page:

1. responsiveness to the websize, need to figure out the vw,vh,% differences.
2. management of overflowing info when resized
